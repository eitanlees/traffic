Aaahhh that fresh repository smell. Let's see how long it takes to muck things up.

I have never used [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) before, so lets give that a shot!
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

To install the dependencies only, such as when deploying this application, run the install command with the --no-root flag:
```bash
poetry install --no-root
```
